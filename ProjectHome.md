Very small and clean file upload solution for use with GWT, and App Engine.

This project will support:

  * HTML5 multiple file selection
  * Drag and drop file upload
  * Custom (styled) file selection button
  * Progress bar


## Design ##

  * MVP front-end
  * Simple to use API

## Status ##

For DND upload support I recommend using http://www.vectomatic.org/libs/lib-gwt-file

This project is still early stage. Many features are working however currently it is not a drop in solution. You will need to play with the source to get it working in your project.
